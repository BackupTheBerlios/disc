DISC (DIameter Server Client) is an AAA diameter implementation. DISC can be configured to act as a diameter server or a diameter client.
DISC enables a flexible plug-in model for new applications. Third parties can easily link their plug-ins with the server or client code and provide thereby adavanced and customized services.

For more information see INSTALL and the example configurations in src/*.cfg.


Configuration files
--------------------

default location for this files is {INSTALL_PATH}/etc/disc/. (default
{INSTALL_PATH} is /usr/local/) default filename 
(i.e. the one loaded when no -f option is specified) is "disc.cfg". two 
examples are provided: aaa_server.cfg and aaa_client.cfg. 
the configuration files have the format:

	config_option = value

disc will run as a server when: 

	aaa_status = AAA_SERVER 

and as a client when:

	aaa_status = AAA_CLIENT
for disc to be useful you'll need to specify one module which it has to
run. there are two ways of locating modules:

1. using module_path. you'll define something like  

module_path=/here/is_the_path_where/I_keep/my/modules

and after that you'll define the module to be loaded like:

module=my_very_bloated_and_useless_module.so

2. using a full path for the module:

module=./client/modules/print/.libs/my_module
(the path is relative to the directory where disc is started from)

both in the case of a server and in the case of a client you will have to 
define: its own realm (aaa_realm), its fqdn (aaa_fqdn) and its peers. 
(note that for a client you'll define only one peer, the server to which
the client has to connect)

peers are defined like:

peer = aaa_identity alias

(example: peer  aaa://lugduf.mobis.fokus.gmd.de:1812;transport=tcp  lugduf)

for the server you have to define the routing table. this is done by saying
which is the next hop for a certain domain. a route in the routing table
for the realm mobis.ip6 is:

route mobis.ip6   lugduf 

(assuming that lugduf was declared as an alias before. or is the actual 
fqdn of the host)

note that in the case of the server every next hop MUST be defined as a peer.


Writing Modules / Diameter API
------------------------------

AAA application specific support in disc is implemented by means of
custom modules. 

the main data structure associated to a module is "struct module_exports" 
which has the following definition:

struct module_exports{
    char* name; /* module name, must be unique */
    unsigned int mod_type; /* module's type - server or client */
    unsigned int app_id; /* application id*/
    unsigned int flags; /* flags */
    struct module_param* params;/* module parameters, null terminated array*/
   
    int (*mod_init)();   /* module initialization function */
    void (*mod_destroy)(); /* called on exit */
    
    int (*mod_msg)(AAAMessage*, void*); /* called for each message */
    int (*mod_tout)(int, AAASessionId*, void*);  /* called for all timeout */
};

a module has to implement the following functions:

	o  int mod_init() - it is run at module loading and usually would
	read configuration variables and set up the initial configuration.

	o  void mod_destroy() - it is run on exit and it can be used 
	for cleaning up.

	o  int mod_msg(AAAMessage* message, void* context) - it is run by 
	disc for every received AAA command belonging to the application 
	implemented by the module. 
	one specifies the AAA application implemented by the
	module by setting the "app_id" field in the "struct module_exports"
	data structure. 
	the received message is pointed to by "message"; "context" points to
	the arbitrary context related to the session this message is part
	of. 

	o  int mod_tout(int flags, AAASessionId* session, void* context) - 
	two kinds of timeouts can occur: a session timeout or a transaction 
	timeout. 
	when either of the two appears and the module has to do with it (i.e. it
	has created this session or transaction), then this function will be
	called. the "flags" will tell you what kind of timeout has occured:
	flags==ANSWER_TIMEOUT_EVENT means a transaction timed out, whereas
	flags==SESSION_TIMEOUT_EVENT means the end of a session.
	the parameter "session" points to the actual value of the AAA session id, 
	and "context" points to the arbitrary context related to this
	session. 

for implementing disc modules one can rely on the diameter API functions
already provided by disc. for that one needs to include 
src/diameter_api/diameter_api.h. the implementation of this API is based
on draft-ietf-aaa-diameter-api-03; however NOT all the functions
specified there are implemented and the implementation is NOT provided
(at least for the time being) as an separate library.


three example modules are provided:

1.  src/client/modules/print

2.  src/client/modules/mipv6 - a module implementing loosely the 
(AAA client part of) mipv6 AAA application as specified in
<draft-le-aaa-diameter-mobileipv6-03.txt> 

3.  src/server/modules/mipv6_server - a module implementing loosely the (AAA
server part of) mipv6  AAA application as specified in
<draft-le-aaa-diameter-mobileipv6-03.txt>
