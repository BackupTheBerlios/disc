DISC (DIameter Server Client) is an AAA diameter implementation. DISC can be configured to act as a diameter server or a diameter client.
DISC enables a flexible plug-in model for new applications. Third parties can easily link their plug-ins with the server or client code and provide thereby adavanced and customized services.

For more information see INSTALL and the example configurations in src/*.cfg.

Configuration files
--------------------

default location for this files is {INSTALL_PATH}/etc/disc/. (default
{INSTALL_PATH} is /usr/local/) default filename 
(i.e. the one loaded when no -f option is specified) is "disc.cfg". two 
examples are provided: aaa_server.cfg and aaa_client.cfg. 
the configuration files have the format:

	config_option = value

disc will run as a server when: 

	aaa_status = AAA_SERVER 

and as a client when:

	aaa_status = AAA_CLIENT
for disc to be useful you'll need to specify one module which it has to
run. there are two ways of locating modules:

1. using module_path. you'll define something like  

module_path=/here/is_the_path_where/I_keep/my/modules

and after that you'll define the module to be loaded like:

module=my_very_bloated_and_useless_module.so

2. using a full path for the module:

module=./client/modules/print/.libs/my_module
(the path is relative to the directory where disc is started from)

both in the case of a server and in the case of a client you will have to 
define: its own realm (aaa_realm), its fqdn (aaa_fqdn) and its peers. 
(note that for a client you'll define only one peer, the server to which
the client has to connect)

peers are defined like:

peer = aaa_identity alias

(example: peer  aaa://lugduf.mobis.fokus.gmd.de:1812;transport=tcp  lugduf)

for the server you have to define the routing table. this is done by saying
which is the next hop for a certain domain. a route in the routing table
for the realm mobis.ip6 is:

route mobis.ip6   lugduf 

(assuming that lugduf was declared as an alias before. or is the actual 
fqdn of the host)

note that in the case of the server a next hop MUST be defined as a peer.
