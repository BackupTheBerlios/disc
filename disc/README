DISC (DIameter Server Client) is an AAA diameter implementation. DISC can be configured to act as a diameter server or a diameter client.
DISC enables a flexible plug-in model for new applications. Third parties can easily link their plug-ins with the server or client code and provide thereby adavanced and customized services.

For more information see INSTALL and the example configurations in src/*.cfg.

Configuration files
--------------------

default location for this files is {INSTALL_PATH}/etc/disc/. (default
{INSTALL_PATH} is /usr/local/) default filename 
(i.e. the one loaded when no -f option is specified) is "disc.cfg". two 
examples are provided: aaa_server.cfg and aaa_client.cfg. 
the configuration files have the format:

	config_option = value

disc will run as a server when: 

	aaa_status = AAA_SERVER 

and as a client when:

	aaa_status = AAA_CLIENT

for both of them you will have to define: its own realm (aaa_realm), 
its fqdn (aaa_fqdn) its peers. peers are defined like:

peer = aaa_identity alias
(example: peer  aaa://lugduf.mobis.fokus.gmd.de:1812;transport=tcp  lugduf)

for the server you have to define the routing table. this is done by saying
which is the next hop for a certain domain. a route in the routing table
for the realm mobis.ip6 is:

route mobis.ip6   lugduf 

(assuming that lugduf was declared as an alias before. or is the actual 
fqdn of the host)
note that a next hop MUST be defined as a peer.
