Dependecies

The mipv6 client and server modules require libmysqlclient and libssl.


configure important options
---------------------------

--with-mipv6_modules       - includes the mipv6 server & client modules,
                           equivalent to
                           --with-mipv6_server_module --with_mipv6_client_module
--with-mipv6_server_module - includes only the mipv6 server module
--with-mipv6_client_module - includes only the mipv6 client module

Check also ./configure --help


Compilation
-----------

1. From CVS
-----------

cvs co aaa_server
./rebuild ; make

if you've already run ./rebuild at some past time, use only
./configure ; make
or just make if you are compiling on the same machine.

(if you want to regenerate everything, including libtltdl and scripts,
you should run first ./bootstrap but you need decently recent versions of
autoconf, automake & libtool)


2. From tar.gz
--------------

tar zxvf disc-0.1.0.tar.gz
./configure (or ./configure --with-mipv6_modules)
make
make install (or make DESTDIR=/tmp/foo install)


Creating a distribution
-----------------------

(you should have the full cvs version)

./configure --with-mipv6_mopdules
make dist


WARNING: if you forget --with-mipv6_modules, the mipv6 server and client modules
won't be included in the tar.gz !


Troubleshooting
---------------

Check if your auto* and libtool version are >= than the ones listed at the 
begining of configure.ac.
On FreeBSD the libtool 1.4.2 generated script will not properly link the 
binary. It will eat -lc_r for some reason and it will not pass it to gcc.

If you get automake errors try ./bootstrap. If you don't have libtool try
 aclocal; ./rebuild.



Installation
------------

make install

or

make DESTDIR=/your_destination_dir install


Other usefull targets
---------------------

make dist-gzip     - tar.gz  archive
make dist-bzip2    - tar.bz2 archive
make distclean     - cleans everything configure generated
