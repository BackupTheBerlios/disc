Compilation
-----------

cvs co aaa_server
./rebuild ; make

if you've already run ./rebuild at some past time, use only
./configure ; make
or just make if you are compiling on the same machine.

(if you want to regenerate everything, including libtltdl and scripts,
you should run first ./bootstrap but you need decently recent versions of
autoconf, automake & libtool)


Installation
------------

make install


Other usefull targets
---------------------

make dist-gzip     - tar.gz  archive
make dist-bzip2    - tar.bz2 archive
make distclean     - cleans everything configure generated
