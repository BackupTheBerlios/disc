Compilation
-----------

cvs co aaa_server
./rebuild ; make

if you've already run ./rebuild at some past time, use only
./configure ; make
or just make if you are compiling on the same machine.

(if you want to regenerate everything, including libtltdl and scripts,
you should run first ./bootstrap but you need decently recent versions of
autoconf, automake & libtool)

Troubleshooting
---------------

Check if your auto* and libtool version are >= than the ones listed at the 
begining of configure.ac.
On FreeBSD the libtool 1.4.2 generated script will not properly link the 
binary. It will eat -lc_r for some reason and it will not pass it to gcc.

If you get automake errors try ./bootstrap. If you don't have libtool try
 aclocal; ./rebuild.



Installation
------------

make install


Other usefull targets
---------------------

make dist-gzip     - tar.gz  archive
make dist-bzip2    - tar.bz2 archive
make distclean     - cleans everything configure generated
